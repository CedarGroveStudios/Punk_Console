class PunkConsole:
    """ A CircuitPython-based Atari Punk Console emulation class object based on
    the "Stepped Tone Generator" circuit, "Engineer's Mini-Notebook: 555
    Circuits", Forrest M. Mims III (1984).

    The CedarGrove Punk Console emulates an astable square-wave oscillator and
    synchronized non-retriggerable one-shot monostable multivibrator to create
    the classic stepped-tone generator sound of the Atari Punk Console. As with
    the original circuit, the oscillator frequency and one-shot pulse width are
    the input parameters. Once the Punk Console class is instantiated, the two
    input values are provided and the update() function is called to adjust the
    PWM parameters of the output pin to to create the output waveform.

    Depending on the timer and PWM capabilities of the host MPU board, the
    emulator can easily outperform the original analog circuit. Oscillator
    frequency is only limited by the MPU's PWM duty cycle and frequency
    parameters, which may create output signals well above the practical audio
    hearing range. Therefore, it is recommended that one-shot pulse width input
    be limited to the range of 0.5ms and 5ms and that the oscillator frequency
    input range be between 3Hz and 3kHz -- although experimentation is
    encouraged!

    The repo contains two examples, a simple single-channel console and an
    annoying stereo noisemaker. Input is provided by potentiometers attached to
    two analog input pins.

    The current version of the emulator works only with PWM-capable output pins.
    An analog output (DAC) waveform version is in the works.

    Minimim and maximum input ranges (may be further limited by the MPU):
    pulse_width: 0.05ms to  5000ms
    frequency:      1Hz to >4MHz

    Practical input ranges for audio (empirically determined):
    pulse_width:  0.5ms to 5ms
    frequency:      3Hz to 3kHz

    The CedarGrove Punk Console algorithm uses PWM frequency and duty cycle
    parameters to build the output waveform. The PWM output frequency is an
    integer multiple of the oscillator frequency input compared to the one-shot
    pulse width input:

        pwm_freq = freq_in / (int((pulse_width) * freq_in) + 1)

    The PWM output duty cycle is calculated after the PWM output frequency is
    determined. The PWM output duty cycle is the ratio of the one-shot pulse
    width and the wavelength of the PWM output frequency:

        pwm_duty_cycle = pulse_width * pwm_freq

    Notes:
    Future update: For non-PWM analog output, the plans are to use audiocore
    with a waveform sample in the RawSample binary array, similar to the
    simpleio.tone() helper. The output waveform's duty cycle will be adjusted by
    altering the contents of the array, perhaps with ulab to improve code
    execution time. The audiocore.RawSample.sample_rate frequency is expected to
    be directly proportional to the original algorithm's PWM frequency output
    value, calculated from the sample_rate divided by the length of the
    audiocore.RawSample array (number of samples).

    MIDI control: A version that uses USB and/or UART MIDI is in the queue.

    CV control: A Eurorack version was discussed, it's just a bit lower on the
    to-do list, that's all.  """
